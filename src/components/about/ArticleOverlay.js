        Welcome reader to the UBC Agrobot blog! Here we hope to periodically
        showcase what weâ€™re doing to bring innovation to agriculture, so keep up
        with us for future updates.

        Todayâ€™s post truly marks the beginning of beginnings as the first
        prototype of our flagship Agrobot has just completed construction. The
        team has worked many hours over the summer to bore, turn, cut, and
        assemble every part of the chassis and powertrains to spec. Itâ€™s been a
        long journey that started all the way back in the fall of last year. All
        the component sourcing, all the machine design calculations, and all the
        CAD work has finally accumulated to this. It wasnâ€™t without struggle of
        course. The logistics of working in the off-term reared its pesky head
        from time to time, and donâ€™t get me started on tracking down order
        packages. But seeing the Agrobot leap off the screen and onto the EDC
        table was a great moment of pride to the whole team, and a totem to
        their dedication and perseverance.

      <p className="mt-6 text-[20px] leading-7 w-full">
        A personal highlight for me was working on our wheelâ€™s power
        transmission system. To allow for complete and agile control, each wheel
        is driven and steered individually. This lets the Agrobot swerve,
        strafe, and crabwalk through the fields to get into optimal position for
        spraying. To keep the motors safe from dirt, mud, and impact, weâ€™ve
        elevated each of them off the ground and connected them through systems
        of chains, sprockets, and shafts to deliver power to the wheels. This
        was the first time personally working with chains and sprockets away
        from my bike at home - designing and building it was totally worth the
        grease-stained afternoons. Anything for smooth operation.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-6 text-[20px] leading-7 w-full">
        And it all worked! At least as far as preliminary testing has gone. With
        the help of the navigation teamâ€™s software, weâ€™ve driven the Agrobot
        around the floor of the EDC multiple times. Sighs of relief quickly
        turned into sounds of elation. And the robotâ€™s got power to boot. At
        full juice, itâ€™ll no doubt handle dirt fields, even light mud if the
        rain starts to shower down. Did I mention the chassis is designed to be
        waterproof? I suppose thatâ€™s a blog article for another time, especially
        with the weather this summer. -- Ryan
