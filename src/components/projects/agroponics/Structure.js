            The Structure sub-team integrates the needs of the Automation and Plants sub-teams to create optimal environments for crop growth. Currently, the team is renovating an old 16-foot trailer by adding insulation, heating, electrical systems, a rainwater collection system, and structural reinforcement to support a controlled environment for hydroponic systems. The work is diverse and evolves with the projectâ€™s needs, presenting new and unexpected challenges. This hands-on team addresses multi-scale problems through collaborative and innovative solutions."
