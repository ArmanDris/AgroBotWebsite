The teamâ€™s goal is to use resources in agriculture (land, water, fertilizers, manpower) more efficiently to help improve our environment. Modern irrigation practices are exacerbating water scarcity, drying up entire water systems, and causing extensive land clearance for agriculture. To address these challenges, we leverage a wide variety of technologies to collect and communicate data from hydroponic systems, enabling us to simulate and optimize different preferred growing environments.'
